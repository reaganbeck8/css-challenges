  <div class="block">
    <p> All that is told here happened some time before <br> Mowgli was turned out of the Seeonee Wolf Pack, or <br> revenged
      himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It was in the<br> days when Baloo was teaching him the Law of the Jungle.<br> The
      big, serious, old brown bear was delighted to have so<br> quick a pupil, for the young wolves will only learn as<br>      much
      of the Law of the Jungle as applies to their own<br> pack and tribe, and run away as soon as they can repeat<br> the
      Hunting Verse —‘Feet that make no noise; eyes that<br> can see in the dark; ears that can hear the winds in their<br>      lairs,
      and sharp white teeth, all these things are the marks<br> of our brothers except Tabaqui the Jackal and the Hyaena<br>      whom
      we hate.’ But Mowgli, as a man-cub, had to learn a<br> great deal more than this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black<br>      Panther
      would come lounging through the jungle to see<br> how his pet was getting on, and would purr with his head<br> against
      a tree while Mowgli recited the day’s lesson to<br> Baloo. The boy could climb almost as well as he could<br> swim,
      and swim almost as well as he could run. So Baloo,<br> the Teacher of the Law, taught him the Wood and Water<br> Laws:
      how to tell a rotten branch from a sound one; how<br> to speak politely to the wild bees when he came upon a<br> hive
      of them fifty feet above ground; what to say to Mang<br> the Bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday;<br>      and
      how to warn the water-snakes in the pools before he<br> splashed down among them. None of the Jungle People<br> like
      being disturbed, and all are very ready to fly at an<br> intruder. Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangers’<br>      Hunting
      Call, which must be repeated aloud till it is<br> answered, whenever one of the Jungle-People hunts<br> outside his
      own grounds. It means, translated, ‘Give me<br> leave to hunt here because I am hungry.’ And the answer<br> is, ‘Hunt
      then for food, but not for pleasure.’<br>
      <br> All this will show you how much Mowgli had to learn<br> by heart, and he grew very tired of saying the same thing<br>      over
      a hundred times. But, as Baloo said to Bagheera, one<br> day when Mowgli had been cuffed and run off in a<br> temper,
      ‘A man’s cub is a man’s cub, and he must learn all<br> the Law of the Jungle.’<br>
      <br> ‘But think how small he is,’ said the Black Panther,<br> who would have spoiled Mowgli if he had had his own<br>      way.
      ‘How can his little head carry all thy long talk?’<br>
      <br> ‘Is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed?<br> No. That is why I teach him these things, and that is why<br> I hit him, very softly, when he forgets.’<br>
      <br> ‘Softly! What dost thou know of softness, old Iron-<br> feet?’ Bagheera grunted. ‘His face is all bruised today
      by
      <br> thy— softness. Ugh.’

  <h2 style="text-align:center">‘Better he should</h2>
  <div class="block">
    <p>
      be bruised from head to foot by me<br> who love him than that he should come to harm through<br> ignorance,’ Baloo
      answered very earnestly. ‘I am now<br> teaching him the Master Words of the Jungle that shall<br> protect him with
      the birds and the Snake People, and all<br> that hunt on four feet, except his own pack. He can now<br> claim protection,
      if he will only remember the words,<br> from all in the jungle. Is not that worth a little beating?’

      <br> ‘Well, look to it then that thou dost not kill the man-<br> cub. He is no tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws
      upon.
      <br> But what are those Master Words? I am more likely to<br> give help than to ask it’ —Bagheera stretched out one
      paw
      <br> and admired the steel-blue, ripping-chisel talons at the end<br> of it—‘still I should like to know.’<br>
      <br> ‘I will call Mowgli and he shall say them—if he will.<br> Come, Little Brother!’<br>
      <br> ‘My head is ringing like a bee tree,’ said a sullen little<br> voice over their heads, and Mowgli slid down a
      tree trunk<br> very angry and indignant, adding as he reached the<br> ground: ‘I come for Bagheera and not for thee,
      fat old<br> Baloo!’
      <br>
      <br> ‘That is all one to me,’ said Baloo, though he was hurt<br> and grieved. ‘Tell Bagheera, then, the Master Words
      of
      <br> the Jungle that I have taught thee this day.’<br>

      which people?’ said Mowgli,<br> delighted to show off. ‘The jungle has many tongues. I<br> know them all.’<br>
      <br> ‘A little thou knowest, but not much. See, O Bagheera,<br> they never thank their teacher. Not one small wolfling
      has
      <br> ever come back to thank old Baloo for his teachings. Say<br> the word for the Hunting-People, then—great scholar.’<br>
      <br> ‘We be of one blood, ye and I,’ said Mowgli, giving<br> the words the Bear accent which all the Hunting People<br>      use.
      <br>
      <br> ‘Good. Now for the birds.’<br> Mowgli repeated, with the Kite’s whistle at the end of<br> the sentence.<br>
      <br> ‘Now for the Snake-People,’ said Bagheera.<br> The answer was a perfectly indescribable hiss, and<br> Mowgli kicked
      up his feet behind, clapped his hands<br> together to applaud himself, and jumped on to Bagheera’s<br> back, where
      he sat sideways, drumming with his heels on<br> the glossy skin and making the worst faces he could think<br> of at
      Baloo.

  <h4 style="text-align:center">‘There—there! That </h4>
  <div class="block">
    <p>
      was worth a little bruise,’ said the<br> brown bear tenderly. ‘Some day thou wilt remember me.’<br> Then he turned
      aside to tell Bagheera how he had begged<br> the Master Words from Hathi the Wild Elephant, who<br> knows all about
      these things, and how Hathi had taken<br> Mowgli down to a pool to get the Snake Word from a<br> water-snake, because
      Baloo could not pronounce it, and<br> how Mowgli was now reasonably safe against all accidents<br> in the jungle, because
      neither snake, bird, nor beast would<br> hurt him.<br>
      <br> ‘No one then is to be feared,’ Baloo wound up, patting<br> his big furry stomach with pride.<br>
      <br> ‘Except his own tribe,’ said Bagheera, under his breath;<br> and then aloud to Mowgli, ‘Have a care for my ribs,
      Little
      <br> Brother! What is all this dancing up and down?’<br>
      <br> Mowgli had been trying to make himself heard by<br> pulling at Bagheera’s shoulder fur and kicking hard. When<br>      the
      two listened to him he was shouting at the top of his<br> voice, ‘And so I shall have a tribe of my own, and lead<br>      them
      through the branches all day long.’<br>
      <br> ‘What is this new folly, little dreamer of dreams?’ said<br> Bagheera.

      branches and dirt at old Baloo,’<br> Mowgli went on. ‘They have promised me this. Ah!’<br>
      <br> ‘Whoof!’ Baloo’s big paw scooped Mowgli off<br> Bagheera’s back, and as the boy lay between the big fore-<br>      paws
      he could see the Bear was angry.<br>
      <br> ‘Mowgli,’ said Baloo, ‘thou hast been talking with the<br> Bandar-log—the Monkey People.’<br>
      <br> Mowgli looked at Bagheera to see if the Panther was<br> angry too, and Bagheera’s eyes were as hard as jade stones.<br>
      <br> ‘Thou hast been with the Monkey People—the gray<br> apes—the people without a law—the eaters of everything.<br>      That
      is great shame.’<br>

      my head,’ said Mowgli (he was still<br> on his back), ‘I went away, and the gray apes came down<br> from the trees
      and had pity on me. No one else cared.’ He<br> snuffled a little.<br>
      <br> ‘The pity of the Monkey People!’ Baloo snorted. ‘The<br> stillness of the mountain stream! The cool of the summer<br>      sun!
      And then, man-cub?’<br>
      <br> ‘And then, and then, they gave me nuts and pleasant<br> things to eat, and they—they carried me in their arms
      up
      <br> to the top of the trees and said I was their blood brother<br> except that I had no tail, and should be their
      leader some<br> day.’
